    X "Even when technology was only just born, and during ancient times, people came up with strange mythology."

    X "It is possible that these things, if true, are a result of the advancement of technology and the advancement of ideas created by the mankind."

    X "But this doesn't sound that scary. Actually, it all sounds made up."
